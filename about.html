## About

A results-oriented, enthusiastic and practical Computer Science and Mathematics graduate, who came from Turkey in 2016 in pursuit of superior education and career opportunities. My passion for algorithmic problem-solving drives both my academic work and personal pursuits: I design and code my own games, tackle LeetCode challenges and conduct experiments on Kaggle to enhance my analytical toolkit. Through these activities; I have gained hands-on experience in algorithms and data structures, Python scripting, data science and machine learning that I used to train my own player agents. I thrive in competitive environments, adapt rapidly to new technologies and consistently seek ways to optimise workflows.
